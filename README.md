# Project-Evercrest-2

Project Evercrest 2 (working title) is an ambitious terminal-based RPG.
The game has (rather, will have):
  Impactful decision making
  D&D-esque Character Attributes that factor into how the world treats you
  Custom, unique and high skill ceiling turn-based combat system
  Evolve and gain power throughout your journey
  A long story mode and hundreds of uniquely hand crafted quests, set in the style of how Skyrim did their questing style.

This is mostly a for fun project, but prioritizes good game design and good computer science principles in its code.

This project, unlike the previous one, utilizes a Curses module to manipulate the terminal and display information to the terminal in a more powerful way.

The game is currently in a heavy work in progress.
