What are Levels?

Levels are locations the player can visit. They can be as big or small as needed.
Levels are tied in with their respective Window.
For example, Level: Valatene Kingdom would be associated with Window: Valatene Kingdom
Valatene Kingdom's window would talk to Valatene Kingdom's level to react to inputs and process requests.
This may be set to change.
